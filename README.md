# AirBnB_clone

One of the significant undertakings within the ALX Software Engineering program is the first project related to web development.
Nonetheless, this project is subdivided into various sub-projects, which encompass:
AirBnB Clone - The Console
AirBnB Clone - Web static
AirBnB Clone - MySQL
AirBnB Clone - Deploy static
AirBnB Clone - Web framework
AirBnB Clone - RESTful API
AirBnB Clone - Web Dynamic
In this project, we encountered approximately 18 distinct tasks to solve. The advantage of these tasks lies in their ability to dissect the overall project into more manageable segments, allowing us to focus on each task individually.

Furthermore, as these tasks come with clear prompts to guide us , their execution often becomes relatively straightforward.
This project have to be  ended in 7 days and demanded a team consisting of two members.
We began with a thorough review of the concept pages and extensive brainstorming sessions to formulate our project approach. Ultimately, we made the decision to convene daily for as many hours as possible, dedicating our available time and effort to the project.

The initial tasks we tackled were relatively straightforward. However, there were some among them for which we lacked prior knowledge, prompting us to search online for resources that could provide us with explanations. I distinctly recall one such task: "How to utilize the UUID module in Python."
